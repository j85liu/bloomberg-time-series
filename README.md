# Hybrid Time Series Forecasting for Financial Assets

This project combines multiple forecasting methods (DeepAR, Temporal Fusion Transformer, N-BEATSx) to address the weaknesses of individual models in financial asset forecasting.

## Approach

We implement several hybrid model strategies:

1. **Ensemble Methods**: Weighted combinations of individual model predictions
2. **Model Switching Framework**: Dynamically selects the best model based on market conditions
3. **Stacking/Meta-learning**: Uses a meta-model to learn optimal combinations of base forecasters
4. **Hybrid Architectures**: Combines architectural elements from different models

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run example: `python main.py`

## Implementation Complexity

The hybrid approaches are implemented in order of increasing complexity:

1. **Ensemble Methods**: Easiest to implement, requires minimal additional code beyond the base models
2. **Model Switching**: Moderate complexity, focuses on regime detection and switching logic
3. **Stacking/Meta-learning**: Higher complexity, requires careful training of meta-models
4. **Hybrid Architectures**: Most complex, combines architectural elements for a unified model

## Hardware Requirements

- Ensemble & Model Switching: Standard CPU, minimal GPU requirements
- Stacking: Moderate GPU recommended for meta-model training
- Hybrid Architectures: Significant GPU resources required for training

## Contributions

This project aims to advance the state of financial forecasting by combining the strengths of multiple approaches while mitigating their individual weaknesses.
